Introduction

The aim is to create a system that allows prospective tenants to view availableproperties and register their interest for specific properties. The system should, via email,
notify the agent responsible for the relevant property when a tenant has indicated interest.That agent should be able to log in to the system and view the details of tenants who have
indicated interest on properties that the agent manages. This view should only be availableto the agent (and an admin). I.e. a public page for prospective tenants to register interest,
and a login page for agents/admin to view the tenant responses specific to their properties.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to streamline the process of property viewing and tenant registration for real estate agencies. By providing a user-friendly interface for both tenants and agents/admins, this system aims to improve efficiency and communication in the property rental process.

features:

Public Page for Prospective Tenants:

Displays available properties with details such as location, rent, and amenities.
Allows prospective tenants to register their interest for specific properties by providing their contact information.
Sends email notifications to the responsible agent when a tenant registers interest for a property.
Login Page for Agents/Admins:

Agents/admins can securely log in to the system using their credentials.
Upon login, agents/admins have access to a dashboard where they can view tenant responses specific to the properties they manage.
Only agents/admins have access to this view, ensuring data privacy and security.


Implementation:
The Property Management System is built using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework  Flask for server-side logic. The system utilizes a relational database sqlite database to store property and tenant information securely. Email notifications are implemented using SMTP email service provider.

Difficulties and Challenges:
Its has been over a year ago since I have used python, so I had to read up alot of documation on the syntax and the function.
I haven't used flask, so thta is new to me.This is the first time using bootstrap in a project.The html pages do look the way I want them to look because I am more of backend.I tried to create something with index.html but it did not work well.The flask_mail api did not work,so I used the built-in function of python to send the email alert.

Conclusion:
I enjoyed do this project.I have learn't alot of new things such as flask and improved my html skills.Building a website such as this take alot of work and late-nights,but I enjoyed the time of doing this experience.
